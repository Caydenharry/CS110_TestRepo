// I completed the initilizeBoard function and the displayBoard function - Cayden
// Added #include <cstdlib>, function for coin toss - CoinFlip()
// also added a welcome screen as well as an optional function for RuleSet() to be displayed in
// the beginning. I also widened the board a bit. - Isaac

    cout << "   - Players decide who will go first, often by a coin flip or mutual agreement." << endl;
    cout << "   - Each player chooses a color of disc, typically red and yellow, which distinguishes their moves, in this case it will be either X or O." << endl;
    cout << endl;
    cout << "2. Objective of the Game" << endl;
    cout << "   - The primary goal is to connect four of your discs in a straight line(vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) before your opponent does." << endl;
    cout << "   - The game ends as soon as a player achieves a line of four connected discs, or if the grid fills up with no winner, resulting in a draw." << endl;
    cout << endl;
    cout << "3. Gameplay" << endl;
    cout << "   - Turns: Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player drops one disc from the top of any of the seven columns." << endl;
    cout << "   - Column Capacity: Each column can hold up to six discs(one per row).Once a column is filled with six discs, no more discs can be dropped into that column." << endl;
    cout << endl;
    cout << "4. Winning Conditions" << endl;
    cout << "   - Four in a Row: A player wins by being the first to align four of their discs consecutively in one of the following ways:" << endl;
    cout << "   - Horizontally: Four discs in a straight line across any row." << endl;
    cout << "   - Vertically: Four discs in a straight line down any column." << endl;
    cout << "   - Diagonally: Four discs in a diagonal line, either from bottom - left to top - right or from bottom - right to top - left." << endl;
    cout << "   - Draw: If all columns are filled and no player has achieved a four - disc connection, the game ends in a draw." << endl;
